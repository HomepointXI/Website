## Reporting A Bug

## Forewarning!

Failure to follow these templates will result in your issue being closed and ignored. I am not going to babysit people and explain to them how to read the rules. If you ignore them you will be ignored in return.

Please review the current issues reported as well before making a new bug report or feature request. Your report may already exist. Feel free to add more information to an existing report if that is the case. The more info possible on something the better.

Please be sure to only post 1 bug report or feature request per-ticket. You can make as many bug reports or feature requests as you like. Just be sure to only post one in each ticket!
